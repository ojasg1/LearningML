#Deploying a ML Model on flask
Trained a Machine learning model to classify iris flower based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width using K- nearest neighbor classification algorithm
Stored the trained Ml model in a pickle file named model.pkl
Using the pickle file created a flask program to deploy the model on local server of a computer
